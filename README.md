# Open Triple Pulse Test (TPT)
Open Source measurement system for core losses.
## Concept
Paper: [Triple Pulse Test (TPT) for Characterizing Magnetic Components](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/triple-pulse-test-tpt-for-characterizing-power-loss-in-magnetic-c)

## Discontinuous procedure
First pulse – establish dc-bias – no additional dc bias source needed!
Second pulse(s) – stabilizing
Third pulse – target cycle (steady state)
