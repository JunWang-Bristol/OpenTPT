# Triple Pulse Test (TPT)
Open Source measurement system for core losses.
## Concept
Paper: [Triple Pulse Test (TPT) for Characterizing Magnetic Components](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/triple-pulse-test-tpt-for-characterizing-power-loss-in-magnetic-c)

## Discontinuous procedure
- **First pulse** – establish dc-bias – no additional dc bias source needed!
- **Second pulse(s)** – stabilizing
- **Third pulse** – target cycle (steady state)

## Features
- Short transition (100 ~ 500 µs) - good for rapid testing, e.g. end-of-line, 100% testing
- Bidirectional current flow - emulate practical BH loop in PWM converters
- Reduced setup requirement - low-cost
- Neglectable heat generated - constant temperature

## Testing circuit - half bridge
Degree of freedom to compensate for asymmetric rectangular voltage amplitude
