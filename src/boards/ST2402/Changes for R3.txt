ST2402 rev 2 needed board fixes

1) 12v power trace between U1 & U7 is missing
2) U1 & U7 footprint is off for Vin+ - pin 2
3) ideally a little more space between U1 & U7 for hand soldering - is tight
4) J13, J19 footprint is off or holes too small
5) standoffs too close to ST micro board
6) swap standoff and diff probe connector locations so can access current loop on top
7)
